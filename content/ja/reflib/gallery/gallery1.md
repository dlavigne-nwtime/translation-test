Covered Bridge Farms is on older development about 2.4 km west of campus. It is nestled in a corner of the state next to Maryland and Pennsylvania where the state boundaries come together.

Our house is surrounded by a grove of self-pruning trees, some of which make good antenna towers.

#### Community

Our community has twisty rustic streets with lots of foilage and mature trees. The entrance from Wedgewood Road is through a real covered bridge, one of three known in Delaware.
