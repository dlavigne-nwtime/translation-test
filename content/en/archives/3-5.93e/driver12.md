#### Description

This driver supports the KSI/Odetics TPRO and TPRO-SAT IRIG-B Decoder, which is a module connected directly to the SBus of a Sun workstation. The module works with the IRIG-B signal generated by several radio clocks, including those made by Arbiter, Austron, Odetics, Spectracom and TrueTime, among others, although it is generally an add- on option. In the case of the TPRO-SAT, the module is an integral part of a GPS receiver, which serves as the primary timing source. 

Using the TPRO interface as a NTP reference clock provides precision time only to xntpd and its clients. With suitable kernel modifications, it is possible to use the TPRO as the CPU system clock, avoiding errors introduced by the CPU clock oscillator wander. See the [A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping](/archives/3-5.93e/kern) page for further details.
